# modelscraper
A webscraper which allows re-usage of components from other scrapers
By creating a model for the website you want to scrape, parts of the model can be used for other websites, or the model can be adapted for other websites.
The advantage of this is that scrapers don't have to be written specifically for each website and that the data from different sources which need to be grouped together have the same format.
